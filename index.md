# [](#welcome)Welcome
Welcome to the Record Expungement documentation site.

This site is currently in its infancy, however all documentation is currently in the process of being consolidated here.

If you would like to contribute great!

Head over to the projects [README](https://github.com/codeforpdx/recordexpungPDX#recordexpungpdx) to get started.

To learn more about the front-end this [wiki guide](https://github.com/codeforpdx/recordexpungPDX/wiki/Frontend) will be helpful.
